     xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
     android:layout_width="match_parent"
     android:layout_height="match_parent"
     android:background="@android:color/white"
     >
 
   <eminayar.com.cardhelper.HelperCardsLayout
       android:id="@+id/cardHelper"
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="match_parent"

       app:overlay_color="#000000"

Interaction Cards Layout with simply [sample module] (https://github.com/kngfrhzs/Interaction-Cards-Layout/blob/master/app/src/main/java/eminayar/com/helpercards/MainActivity.java).

There is ```Card Item``` model defined in project. You should create an `ArrayList<CardItem>` to 
inflate your cards. It is basic model that contains ; `title, description, image`. 

### JAVA Part of Usage

````java
HelperCardsLayout layout = (HelperCardsLayout) findViewById(R.id.cardHelper);

    ArrayList<CardItem> cardItems = new ArrayList<>();

    cardItems.add(new CardItem("Short Title With Image",
        "Description this can be some long text, " + "layout" + "will scale itself",
        R.drawable.barchart));

    cardItems.add(new CardItem("Short Title With No Image",
        "Description this can be some long text, layout" + "will scale itself"));

    cardItems.add(new CardItem("Long title example to demonstrate users how can this textview can"
        + " be longer and longer with image",
        "Description this can be some long text, layout" + "will scale itself",
        R.drawable.getmoney));

    cardItems.add(new CardItem("Long title example to demonstrate users how can this textview can"
        + " be longer and longer without image",
        "Description this can be some long text, layout" + "will scale itself"));

    cardItems.add(new CardItem("Very very long description example",
        "Description this can be some long text, layout"
            + "will scale itself"
            + "Description this can be some long text, layout"
            + "will scale itself"
            + "Description this can be some long text, layout"
            + "will scale itself", R.drawable.celebration));

    layout.setItems(cardItems);
    layout.setOnCardClickListener(this);
    layout.setOnCardLongClickListener(this);
```` 

You can `setOnCardClickListener` and `setOnCardLongClickListener`.
